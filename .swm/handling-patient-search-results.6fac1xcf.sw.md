title: Handling Patient Search Results
---
In this document, we will explain the process that occurs when a patient is found. The process involves several key steps to ensure the correct handling and notification of the patient's information.

The flow starts with identifying a patient in the system. Once the patient is found, the system proceeds to verify the patient's details. After verification, the system sends a notification to the relevant parties to inform them that the patient has been located. This ensures that all necessary actions can be taken based on the patient's information.

Here is a high level diagram of the flow, showing only the most important functions:
