# DbSet Properties

# Database Management

The database in the Link module is managed through the `LinkPatientContext` class, which extends the `DbContext` class from Entity Framework Core.

# Querying and Saving Data

This context class includes several `DbSet` properties that represent collections of different entities, such as `LinkEnquires`, `LinkedAccounts`, `CareContextMap`, and <SwmToken path="src/In.ProjectEKA.HipService/Link/Database/Migrations/20200419184602_IntiatedLinkRequest.cs" pos="10:2:2" line-data="                &quot;InitiatedLinkRequest&quot;,">`InitiatedLinkRequest`</SwmToken>.

# Model Configuration

These `DbSet` properties allow for querying and saving instances of these entities to the database.

# Migrations

The `OnModelCreating` method in the `LinkPatientContext` class is overridden to configure the model using the `ModelBuilder`. This method sets up the relationships between the entities and configures various properties, such as default values and constraints.

Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time. For example, the <SwmToken path="src/In.ProjectEKA.HipService/Link/Database/Migrations/20200419184602_IntiatedLinkRequest.cs" pos="5:7:7" line-data="    public partial class IntiatedLinkRequest : Migration">`IntiatedLinkRequest`</SwmToken> and `LinkRequestMigrations` classes represent different migration steps.

```c#
ï»¿namespace In.ProjectEKA.HipService.Link.Database.Migrations
```
