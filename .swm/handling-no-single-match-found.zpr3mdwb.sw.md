title: Handling No Single Match Found
---
In this document, we will explain the process that occurs when no single match is found. The process involves several steps to ensure that the appropriate actions are taken when a match is not identified.

The flow starts by checking if there is a single match. If no single match is found, the system proceeds to handle this scenario by performing specific actions to address the lack of a match. This ensures that the process continues smoothly even when a match is not identified.

Here is a high level diagram of the flow, showing only the most important functions:
