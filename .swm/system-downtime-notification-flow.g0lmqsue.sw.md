title: System Downtime Notification Flow
---
In this document, we will explain the process of sending notifications when Bahmni or an external system is down. The process involves checking the system status, determining if a notification should be sent, and then sending the appropriate notification.

The flow involves three main steps: checking the status of Bahmni or an external system, deciding if a notification is necessary, and sending the notification if required.

Here is a high level diagram of the flow, showing only the most important functions:
